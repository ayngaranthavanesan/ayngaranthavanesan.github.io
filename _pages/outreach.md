I am passionate about sharing the excitement of physics and cosmology with the wider public. My outreach work spans a variety of audiences, from school students and early-career researchers to general science enthusiasts. I aim to make complex topics like quantum gravity, black holes, and the early universe accessible, engaging, and inspiring for everyone. 

A key part of my outreach philosophy is promoting **Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)** in science. As a first-generation Eelam Tamil student from a working-class family, I am acutely aware of the barriers that underrepresented groups face in academia. I actively strive to create inclusive environments and opportunities, mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, supporting women and minority researchers in physics, and co-founding the non-profit organisation [UniArk](https://www.uniark.org/) to improve access to higher education in STEM fields. Through my talks, workshops, and public engagement activities, I aim to demonstrate that scientific curiosity is for everyone, regardless of background.
