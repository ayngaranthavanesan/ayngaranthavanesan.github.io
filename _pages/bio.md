This is the website of Ayngaran Thavanesan, the British and (perhaps 1st-ever?) theoretical cosmologist of Eelam Tamil descent.

Ayngaran is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, working on the wavefunction of the universe and the cosmological correlators encoded therein.

Ayngaran Thavanesan is based at the University of Cambridge's Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambrige, which brings together cosmologists from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), Cavendish Astrophysics group and the Institute of Astronomy (IoA). Ayngaran works with a variety of people, including [Will Handley](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/directory/wh260), [Enrico Pajer](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ep551), [Anne-Christine Davis](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ad107), [Daniel Baumann](http://cosmology.amsterdam/members/daniel-baumann/) and [Guilherme Pimentel](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/e/g.leitepimentel/g.leite-pimentel.html). Originally from London in the south of England, Ayngaran completed a Bachelor's degree in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy and a Master's degree in Queen Mary University of London with [Timothy Clifton](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/people/academics/profiles/tclifton.html), before spending a year in Oxford working under the primary supervision of Will Handley and moving back to Cambridge to complete his PhD. Ayngaran is interested in theoretical cosmology and fundamental physics, particularly using fundamental principles to contrain the cosmological observables seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background and Large Scale Structure, i.e. cosmological correlators. Ayngaran also has additional interests beyond physics, including fitness and the science behind it. He is a comptetitive 1st team [Cambridge Blue](https://www.bluebirdnews.co.uk/cambridge-badminton-1sts-take-on-loughborough/) badminton and football player, and has interests in tech startups including his own [NightLYF](http://nightlyf.co.uk/). Ayngaran is involved in various equality and diversity initiatives, including the founding of the non-profit organisation [UniArk](https://www.uniark.org/), and has given a number of public science outreach talks available on [Happs](https://happs.tv/@AyngaranThavanesan) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ayngaran+Thavanesan).
