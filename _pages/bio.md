I am a theoretical physicist and cosmologist currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at EPFL (Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne), and as a scientific collaborator at CERN. I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge’s Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), where I was advised by [Aron Wall](http://www.wall.org/~aron/). During my PhD, I was also affiliated with the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge (KICC), which brings together cosmologists from DAMTP, the Cavendish Astrophysics group, and the Institute of Astronomy (IoA). I have collaborated with a variety of people, including [David Stefanyszyn](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/david.stefanyszyn), [Will Handley](https://www.willhandley.co.uk/), [Eva Silverstein](https://sitp.stanford.edu/people/eva-silverstein) and [Shota Komatsu](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/theoretical-physics/people/academic-staff/).

My research centres around cosmology and fundamental physics, with the particular goal of understanding the origin of the universe and gaining insights into a potential theory of everything unifying the fundamental forces. My current research program focuses on quantum gravity in de Sitter (dS) space, studied through the dS wavefunction (or equivalently the cosmological correlators encoded therein). I use techniques from holography (i.e. dS/CFT) and [cosmological bootstrapping](https://durhamuniversity.zoom.us/rec/share/ZOPoio1yq-vlX-XmqhB0FqdBV1zgAT_vRxNpfvx56FFQX93VvI9oWMfhXybYtWu4.HyQFs5RLJltLxzZs?startTime=1671121507000) to make concrete predictions for observables in the night sky today, such as the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://youtu.be/AYFDN2DSVgc).

In 2021, I was awarded the [Institute of Physics (IOP) Bell Burnell Graduate scholarship](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/bell-burnell-fund/2021-awardees/ayngaran-thavanesan) and the [David and Susan Hibbitt scholarship of Jesus College, Cambridge](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/jesus-college-david-and-susan-hibbitt-scholarship-202021)￼in support of my PhD studies at Cambridge, alongside additional funding from the Cavendish Trust.

I was born and raised in South London, and my parents came to England as refugees fleeing the [genocide committed against our Eelam Tamil ethnic group by the Sri Lankan state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_genocide) not long before. Due to these difficult circumstances, I come from an atypical bacgkround within academia, as I am a first-generation student from a working class family. I am also the first from the Eelam Tamil ethnic group to pursue the field of theoretical physics and/or cosmology. In this sense, my background is often compared to that of [Michael Faraday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday), in that I am the first in my family to obtain any academic qualifications. This makes me that much prouder to have completed a Bachelor’s degree at Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, followed by a Master’s degree at Queen Mary University of London with [Timothy Clifton](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/people/academics/profiles/tclifton.html). I then spent a year in Oxford before returning to Cambridge to complete my PhD.

I hope that my journey demonstrates to people from backgrounds like mine that one’s past and circumstances need not determine one’s future. I remain deeply indebted to the support and encouragement of people such as [Cathie Clarke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathie_Clarke) and [Christopher Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_S._Reynolds), as well as many other remarkable staff, including Susan Hatley at Cambridge’s IoA, for their generosity, hospitality, and mentorship during my pre-doctoral studies.

Beyond physics, I maintain a strong interest in fitness and the science behind it. I am a competitive 1st team [Cambridge Blue](https://www.bluebirdnews.co.uk/cambridge-badminton-1sts-take-on-loughborough/) badminton and football player, and I am also interested in technology startups, including my own venture [NightLYF](http://nightlyf.co.uk/). As a natural consequence of coming from an underrepresented background, I am a strong advocate for equality and diversity, and I am involved in several initiatives in this space, including the founding of the non-profit organisation [UniArk](https://www.uniark.org/). I am also passionate about science outreach and public engagement, and have given several outreach talks available on [Happs](https://happs.tv/@AyngaranThavanesan) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ayngaran+Thavanesan).
