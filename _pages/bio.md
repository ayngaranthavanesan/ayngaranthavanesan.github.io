Ayngaran Thavanesan is a theoretical physics PhD candidate based at the University of Cambridge's Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambrige, which brings together cosmologists from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP), Cavendish Astrophysics group and the Institute of Astronomy (IoA). Ayngaran works with a variety of people, including [Will Handley](https://www.kicc.cam.ac.uk/directory/wh260), [Enrico Pajer](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ep551), [Anne-Christine Davis](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ad107), [Daniel Baumann](http://cosmology.amsterdam/members/daniel-baumann/) and [Guilherme Pimentel](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/l/e/g.leitepimentel/g.leite-pimentel.html). Ayngaran's research centres around cosmology and fundamental physics with the particular goal to use the arena of high energy physics present after the Big Bang to gain insights into a potential theory of everything unifying the fundamental forces. Hi current research direction involves constraining the wavefunction of the universe (or equivalently cosmological correlators) using fundamental principles, i.e. cosmological bootstrapping, to make predictions about observables in the night sky today, such as the cosmic microwave background. In 2021 Ayngaran was awarded a [Institue of Physics (IOP) Bell Burnell Graduate scholarship](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/bell-burnell-fund/2021-awardees/ayngaran-thavanesan) and the [David and Susan Hibbitt scholarship of Jesus College, Cambridge](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/jesus-college-david-and-susan-hibbitt-scholarship-202021) for his PhD studies at Cambridge.

Although he was born and raised in South London, Ayngaran's Tamil parents came to England as refugees from Sri Lanka not long before. His atypical background is akin to that of Faraday's, as he is the first from his low-income family to have any academic qualifications. Despite these difficult circumstances, Ayngaran went on to complete a Bachelor's degree in Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy and a Master's degree in Queen Mary University of London with [Timothy Clifton](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/people/academics/profiles/tclifton.html), before spending a year in Oxford working under the primary supervision of Will Handley and moving back to Cambridge to complete his PhD. He hopes that this will demonstrate to people like him that one’s past and circumstances can be inconsequential of one’s future.

Ayngaran maintains various interests beyond physics, including fitness and the science behind it. He is a comptetitive 1st team [Cambridge Blue](https://www.bluebirdnews.co.uk/cambridge-badminton-1sts-take-on-loughborough/) badminton and football player, and has interests in tech startups including his own [NightLYF](http://nightlyf.co.uk/). As a natural consequence of coming from an underrepresented background, he is a strong equality and diversity advocate, and is involved in various equality and diversity initiatives, including the founding of the non-profit organisation [UniArk](https://www.uniark.org/). He is also enthusiastic to share his passion for science with the general public, and has given a number of science outreach talks available on [Happs](https://happs.tv/@AyngaranThavanesan) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ayngaran+Thavanesan).
