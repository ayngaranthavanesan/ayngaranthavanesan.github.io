This is the website of Ayngaran Thavanesan, the British and (perhaps 1st-ever?) theoretical cosmologist of Eelam Tamil descent.

Ayngaran is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge, working on the wavefunction of the universe and the cosmological correlators encoded therein. He is a [Institute of Physics (IOP) Bell Burnell Graduate scholar](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/bell-burnell-fund/2021-awardees/ayngaran-thavanesan) and [honorary (declined financial award of scholarship) David and Susan Hibbitt scholar of Jesus College, Cambridge](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/jesus-college-david-and-susan-hibbitt-scholarship-202021).
