Hi I am Ayngaran! I am a cosmologist and theoretical physicist, working on quantum gravity to understand things like the beginning of our universe. I am part of the Eelam Tamil diaspora in England and am actually the first of the Eelam Tamil ethnic group to pursue the field of high-energy physics and/or cosmology. I am hoping my journey makes others from my ethnic group, as well as those from less common backgrounds, to feel less alone, whether they are one of the few from underrepresented backgrounds in academia or trailblazers in other fields!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist (aka postdoc) at EPFL (Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne). Prior to this, I did a brief stint as a postdoc at the Department of Applied Mathematics & Thoeretical Physics at the University of Cambridge as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist, working on cosmology and quantum gravity, after having completed my PhD in the same department. As a PhD candidate I was lucky enough to be founded by a [Institute of Physics (IOP) Bell Burnell Graduate scholarship](https://www.iop.org/about/support-grants/bell-burnell-fund/2021-awardees/ayngaran-thavanesan), Cavendish Trust scholarship as well as an [honorary (declined financial award of scholarship) David and Susan Hibbitt scholarship of Jesus College, Cambridge](https://www.student-funding.cam.ac.uk/jesus-college-david-and-susan-hibbitt-scholarship-202021).
