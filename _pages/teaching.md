I am deeply committed to mentoring and teaching across all academic levels — from high school students to advanced graduate courses. I am particularly passionate about supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds and helping them navigate academic pathways in physics, mathematics, and cosmology.

Mentoring & Research Supervision
---------------------------------

Advisor / Mentor — Mentoring Flatiron Intern (Aug. 2024 – Present)  
**USA & Online**

I supervise undergraduate student [Ezra Msolla](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/newsletter/interactions-fall-2023/) from an underrepresented background with interests in cosmology. In our joint work, we derived analytical expressions for tensor power spectra in curved inflating universes, developing model-independent templates that isolate curvature effects.

Lumiere Education — Research Project Supervisor (Mar. 2023 – Present)  
**Online (volunteering and paid work)**

I have supervised 9 students’ individual research projects on topics including cosmology and Hawking radiation. Many of these students have gone on to be admitted to prestigious universities such as Harvard and Stanford.

UniArk — Co-founder & Mentor (Mar. 2021 – Present)  
**UK & Online**

I co-founded [UniArk](https://www.uniark.org) with the aim of reducing the educational attainment gap for disadvantaged students. I mentor students for Oxbridge and other university admissions at undergraduate, Masters, and PhD levels.
